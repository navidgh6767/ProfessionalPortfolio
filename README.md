## üìò Artifact Overview

The **Surgio Chatbot** is an AI-powered conversational assistant built using **Streamlit**, **Python**, and **large language models (LLMs)**. The project explores how natural language processing (NLP) can enhance human‚ÄìAI communication and deliver context-aware responses in real time.

As a core contributor, I participated in **designing, developing, and deploying** the chatbot ‚Äî integrating both the technical backend and an intuitive front-end experience. The system demonstrates practical applications of **AI/ML principles** and the importance of user-centered design in AI systems.
